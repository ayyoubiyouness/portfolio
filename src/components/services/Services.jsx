                    During my engineering studies, I participated in a semester-long exchange program at the Ã‰cole Centrale de Marseille, specializing in Data Science. This experience provided me with the chance to meet new people and engage in various projects. Key courses included statistics, probability, machine learning, and neural networks.

                    <p>
                    In my first year, I was fortunate to receive a generalist training, which provided me with insights into various engineering fields. This period also presented opportunities to work on multiple projects across different domains and to involve myself in associative activities. Noteworthy courses included Project Management, Fluid Mechanics, Partial Differential Equations, Artificial Intelligence, and Corporate Finance.

                    <p>
                        
During the two years of my preparatory classes, I received a solid theoretical foundation in mathematics, physics, electricity, chemistry, and engineering science. This provided me with a strong base to delve into various scientific fields and successfully pursue my engineering studies.
